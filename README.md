api making practice

This is my first ever time working with backend! 
I made my very own API, that I then used a getFetch API to retrieve the info from 
so I can make a little web app using HTML and JS 

I made an api containing Nintendo devics, their release date, how many sold and their price. 

I chose 5 nintendo devices: The switch, Wii U, 3DS, Wii and DS

In the index.js file you will see how I made the API, I hosted that file online and then made an app
similar to the NASA API, and retrived the data the same way. It was an amazing Experience. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to host it anymore since Heroku is no longer free. Howeverm I will upload a little video
of how the app works.
